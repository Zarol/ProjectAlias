# ProjectAlias
Project Alias is an android-targeted arcade game originally developed for CPE 481 Embedded and Console Games Development course (Fall 2016). The project utilizes [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) and features cross-platform capabilities. Since I am not a game designer, the main focus of this game is writing the systems that run the game. As a result, the program features an Entity-Component-System framework and an Event Listener framework.
